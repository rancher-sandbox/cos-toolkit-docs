The config file reproduced here is meant to be included as a user-data in a cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure, etc) or as part of a cdrom (cOS-Recovery will try to fetch /userdata file from a cdrom device).\nA vanilla image is an image that only provides the cOS-Recovery system on a COS_RECOVERY partition. It does not include any other system and it is meant to be dumped to a bigger disk and deploy a cOS system or a derivative system over the free space in disk. COS vanilla images are build as part of the CI workflow, see CI artifacts to download one of those.\nThe configuration file of this example has two purposes: first it deploys cOS, second in reboots on the deployed OS and deploys K3S + Fleet + System Upgrades Controller.\nOn first boot it will fail to boot cOS grub menu entry and fallback to cOS-Recovery system. From there it will partition the vanilla image to create the main system partition (COS_STATE) and add an extra partition for persistent data (COS_PERSISTENT). It will use the full disk, a disk of at least 20GiB is recommended. After partitioning it will deploy the main system on COS_STATE and reboot to it.\nOn consequent boots it will simply boot from COS_STATE, there it prepares the persistent areas of the system (arranges few bind mounts inside COS_PERSISTENT) and then it runs an standard installation of K3s, Fleet and System Upgrade Controller. After few minutes after the system is up the K3s cluster is up and running.\nNote this setup similar to the derivative example using Fleet.

See the full example in examples/standard.\nGenerating from CI image You can just use the published final images:\n# Pick one version from https://quay.io/repository/costoolkit/releases-opensuse?tab=tags FROM quay.io/costoolkit/releases-opensuse:cos-system-0.5.3-5 COPY files/ / ...

This step generates build metadata (luet build / docker build / buildah ..) Add repository metadata and create a repository from the build phase (luet create-repo) (otherwise, optionally) publish the repository and the artefacts along (luet create-repo --push-images)  While on the client side, the upgrade workflow is:\n luet install (when upgrading from release channels) latest cos on a pristine image file or luet util unpack (when upgrading from specific docker images)  Note: The manual build steps are not stable and will likely change until we build a single CLI to encompass the cos-toolkit components, rather use source .envrc \u0026\u0026 cos-build for the moment being while iterating locally.\nExample The sample repository has the following layout:\n├── Dockerfile ├── .envrc ├── .github │ └── workflows │ ├── build.yaml │ └── test.yaml ├── .gitignore ├── iso.yaml ├── LICENSE ├── .luet.yaml ├── Makefile ├── packages │ ├── sampleOS │ │ ├── 02_upgrades.yaml │ │ ├── 03_branding.yaml │ │ ├── 04_accounting.yaml │ │ ├── build.yaml │ │ ├── definition.yaml │ │ └── setup.yaml │ └── sampleOSService │ ├── 10_sampleOSService.yaml │ ├── build.yaml │ ├── definition.yaml │ └── main.go └── README.md In the detail:\n the packages directory is the sample Luet tree that contains the package definitions [1] which composes the derivative. For an overview of the package syntax and build process, see the official luet documentation .luet.yaml contains a configuration file for luet pointing to the cos repositories, used to fetch packages required in order to build the iso [2] and to fetch definitions from [3]. Makefile and .envrc are just wrappers around luet build and luet create-repo iso.yaml a YAML file that describes what packages to embed in the final ISO  Note: There is nothing special in the layout, and neither the packages folder naming is special. By convention we have chosen to put the compilation specs in the packages folder, the Makefile is just calling luet with a set of default parameters according to this setup.\nThe .envrc is provided as an example to automatize the build process: it will build a docker image with the required dependencies, check the development docs about the local requirements if you plan to build outside of docker.\n[1] In the sample above we just declare two packages: sampleOS and sampleOSService. Their metadata are respectively in packages/sampleOS/definition.yaml and packages/sampleOSService/definition.yaml\n[2] We consume live/systemd-boot and live/syslinux from cos instead of building them from the sample repository\n[3] see also using git submodules instead\nSingle image OS Derivatives are composed by a combination of specs to form a final package that is consumed as a single image OS.\nThe container image during installation and upgrade, is converted to an image file with a backing ext2 fs.\nIn the sample repository we have defined system/sampleOS as our package, that will later on will be converted to image.\nPackages in luet have runtime and buildtime specifications into definition.yaml and build.yaml respectively, and in the buildtime we set:\nrequires:- category:\"system\"name:\"cos\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- category:\"app\"name:\"sampleOSService\"version:\"\u003e=0\"This instruct luet to compose a new image from the results of the compilation of the specified packages, without any version constraints, and use it to run any steps and prelude on top of it.\nWe are interested in the dependencies final images, and not the containers used to build them, so we enable requires_final_images:\nrequires_final_images: true We later run arbitrary steps to tweak the image:\nsteps:- ...And we instruct luet to compose the final artifact as a squash of the resulting container image, composed of all the files:\nunpack:trueA detailed explaination of all the keywords available is in the luet docs along with the supported build strategies.\nWe exclude then a bunch of file that we don’t want to be in the final package (regexp supported):\nexcludes:- ..Note: In the EpinioOS sample, we use requires instead of join:\nrequires:- category:\"system\"name:\"cos\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- name:\"k3s\"category:\"app\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- name:\"policy\"category:\"selinux\"version:\"\u003e=0\"The difference is that with requires we use the building container that was used to build the packages instead of creating a new image from their results: we are not consuming their artifacts in this case, but the environment used to build them. See also the luet docs for more details.\nBuilding Refering to the sampleOS example, we set the Makefile accordingly to compile the system package.\nWith luet installed locally and docker running, in your git checkout you can build it also by running luet build --tree packages system/sampleOS. This will produce an artifact of system/sampleOS. Similary, we could also build separately the sample application with luet build --tree packages app/sampleOSService.\nThe build process by default results in a build folder containing the package and the compilation metadata in order to generate a repository.\nNote on reproducibility: See the difference between our two samples repositories for an explanation of what are the implications of using a .luet.yaml file for building instead of a git submodule.\nAdditional packages In our sample repo we have split the logic of a separate application in app/sampleOSService.\nsampleOSService is just an HTTP server that we would like to have permanently in the system and on boot.\nThus we define it as a dependency in the system/sampleOS’s requires section:\nrequires:...- category:\"app\"name:\"sampleOSService\"version:\"\u003e=0\"Note If you are wondering about copying just single files, there is an upstream open issue about it.\nIn this way, when building our sampleOS package, luet will automatically apply the compilation spec of our package on top.\nTemplating The package build definition supports templating, and global interpolation of build files with multiple values files.\nValues file can be specified during build time in luet with the --values flag (also multiple files are allowed) and, if you are familiar with helm it using the same engine under the hood, so all the functions are available as well.\ncos-toolkit itself uses default values files for every supported distributions.\nFor a more complex example involving values file, see the epinio appliance example.\nTemplates uses cases are for: resharing common pieces between flavors, building for different platforms and architectures, …\nUpgrades In order for the derivative to upgrade, it needs to be configured in order to download upgrades from a source.\nBy default, cos derivatives if not specified will point to latest cos-toolkit. To override, you need to or overwrite the content of /system/oem/02_upgrades.yaml or supply an additional one, e.g. /system/oem/03_upgrades.yaml in the final image, see an example here.\nThe configuration need to point to a specific docker image or an upgrade channel, a complete example and documentation is here.\nSee also the dedicated section in the docs.\nOEM Customizations There are several way to customize a cos-toolkit derivative:\n declaratively in runtime with cloud-config file (by overriding, or extending) stateful, via build definition when running luet build.  For runtime persistence configuration, the only supported way is with cloud-config files, see the relevant docs.\nA derivative automatically loads and executes cloud-config files which are hooking into system stages.\nIn this way the cloud-config mechanism works also as an emitter event pattern - running services or programs can emit new custom stages in runtime by running cos-setup stage_name.\nFor an extensive list of the default OEM files that can be reused or replaced see here.\nSee also the dedicated section in the docs.\nSeparate image recovery A separate image recovery can be used during upgrades.\nTo set a default recovery image or a package, set RECOVERY_IMAGE into /etc/cos-upgrade-image. It allows to override the default image/package used during upgrades, see also upgrades.\nTo make an ISO with a separate recovery image as squashfs, you can either use the default from cOS, by adding it in the iso yaml file:\npackages:rootfs:..uefi:..isoimage:...- recovery/cos-imgThe installer will detect the squashfs file in the iso, and will use it when installing the system. You can customize the recovery image as well by providing your own: see the recovery/cos-img package definition as a reference.\nBuilding ISOs, Vagrant Boxes, OVA In order to build an iso at the moment of writing, we first rely on luet-makeiso. It accepts a YAML file denoting the packages to bundle in an ISO and a list of luet repositories where to download the packages from.\nA sample can be found here.\nTo build an iso from a local repository (the build process, automatically produces a repository in build in the local checkout):\nluet-makeiso ./iso.yaml --local build Where iso.yaml is the iso specification file, and --local build is an optional argument to use also the local repository in the build process.\nWe are then free to refer to packages in the tree in the iso.yaml file.\nFor Vagrant Boxes, OVA and QEMU images at the moment of writing we are relying on packer templates.\nKnown issues When building cOS or a cOS derivative, you could face different issues, this section provides a description of the most known ones, and way to workaround them.\nBuilding SELinux fails cOS by default has SELinux enabled in permissive mode. If you are building parts of cOS or cOS itself from scratch, you might encounter issues while building the SELinux module, like so:\nStep 12/13 : RUN checkmodule -M -m -o cOS.mod cOS.te \u0026\u0026 semodule_package -o cOS.pp -m cOS.mod ---\u003e Using cache ---\u003e 1be520969ead Step 13/13 : RUN semodule -i cOS.pp ---\u003e Running in c5bfa5ae92e2 libsemanage.semanage_commit_sandbox: Error while renaming /var/lib/selinux/targeted/active to /var/lib/selinux/targeted/previous.

For all the details and possibilties of Packer check the official documentation.\nRun the build with Packer Publishing an AMI image in AWS based on top of the latest cOS Vanilla image is fairly simple. In fact, it is only needed to set the AWS credentials and run a packer build process to trigger the deployment and register the resulting snapshot as an AMI. In such case the lastest cOS image will be deployed and configured with pure defaults. Consider:\n# From the root of a cOS-toolkit repository checkout \u003e export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\u003cyour_aws_access_key\u003e \u003e export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\u003cyour_aws_secret_access_key\u003e \u003e export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=\u003cyour_aws_default_region\u003e \u003e cd packer \u003e packer build -only amazon-ebs.cos . AWS keys can be passed as environment variables as it is above or packer picks them from aws-cli configuration files (~/.aws) if any. Alternatively, one can define them in the variables file.\nThe -only amazon-ebs.cos flag is just to tell packer which of the sources to make use for the build. Note the packer/images.json.pkr.hcl file defines few other sources such as qemu and virtualbox.\nCustomize the build with a variables file The packer template can be customized with the variables defined in packer/variables.pkr.hcl. These are the variables that can be set on run time using the -var key=value or -var-file=path flags. The variable file can be a json file including desired varibles. Consider the following example:\n# From the packer folder of the cOS-toolkit repository checkout \u003e cat \u003c\u003c EOF \u003e test.json { \"aws_cos_install_args\": \"cos-deploy\", \"aws_launch_volume_size\": 16, \"name\": \"MyTest\" } EOF \u003e packer build -only amazon-ebs.cos -var-file=test.json . The above example runs the AMI Vanilla image on a 16GiB disk and calls the command cos-deploy to deploy the main OS, once deployed an snapshot is created and an AMI out this snapshot is registered in EC2. The created AMI artifact will be called MyTest, the name has no impact in the underlaying OS.\nAvailable variables for customization All the customizable variables are listed in packer/variables.pkr.hcl, variables with the aws_ prefix are the ones related to the AWS Packer template. These are some of the relevant ones:\n  aws_cos_install_args: This the command that will be executed once the Vanilla image booted. In this stage it is expected that user sets a command to install the desired cOS or derivative image. By default it is set to cos-deploy which will deploy the latest cOS image in cOS repositories. To deploy custom derivatives something like cos-deploy --docker-image \u003cmy-derivative-img-ref\u003e should be sufficient.\n  aws_launch_volume_size: This sets the disk size of the VM that Packer launches for the build. During Vanilla image first boot the system will expand to the disk geometry. The layout is configurable with the user-data.\n  aws_user_data_file: This sets the user-data file that will be used for the aws instance during the build process. It defaults to aws/setup-disk.yaml and the defauklt file basically includes the disk expansion configuration. It adds a COS_STATE partition that should be big enough to store about three times the size of the image to deploy. Then it also creates a COS_PERSISTENT partition with all the rest of the available space in disk.\n  aws_source_ami_filter_name: This a filter to choose the AMI image for the build process. It defaults to *cOS*Vanilla* pattern to pick the latest cOS Vanilla image available.\n  ","categories":"","description":"This section documents the procedure to deploy cOS (or derivatives) images in AWS public cloud provider by using the cOS Vanilla image.\n","excerpt":"This section documents the procedure to deploy cOS (or derivatives) …","ref":"/docs/creating-derivatives/build_ami/","tags":"","title":"Build AMI machines for AWS"},{"body":"Requirements:\n cOS-toolkit source Google Cloud access keys with the appropriate roles and permissions gsutil and gcloud tools  The suggested approach high level view is building cOS packages and generating a RAW image from them. That would allow us to transform that RAW image in a valid Google Cloud blob that can be transformed into a VM image ready to be launched.\nThis generates a vanilla image that boots into recovery mode and can be used to deploy whatever image you want to the VM. Then you can snapshot that VM into a VM image ready to deploy with the default cOS system or your derivative.\nBuilding the packages We need to have the packages built locally in order to generate a proper RAW image. Just run:\nsudo make build All the artifacts will be generated under the build directory.\nSee also the dedicated section in the docs for more information about building cOS.\nBuilding the RAW image The RAW image is just a RAW disk image that contains the recovery, so once launched is ready to be used for installing whatever cOS or derivative that you want into the VM disks. This allows us to have a barebones base image that can be used for provisioning whatever cOS you want.\nBuilding the RAW image is as simple as running:\nsudo make raw_disk This will output a disk.raw fiel in the current directory which we will modify to make it work with Google Cloud.\nHINT: You can use this disk.raw locally as a disk for qemu if you want to check that it boots properly.\nTransform the RAW image into a compatible Google Cloud blob Currently importing images from storage blobs on Google Cloud have a few requirements:\n blobs have to be tar.gzipped with the flag --format=oldgnu the disk.raw has to be rounded up to the next Gb ( so no 2.1gb images or 2.4, they need to be an exact 3Gb or 2Gb) image inside the tar.gzip blob needs to be called disk.raw  We provide a make target that will do this for you:\nsudo make gce_disk This will create a disk.raw.tar.gz which is our final artifact\nUploading to Google Cloud storage and importing it as an image The last step is to upload the blob to Google Cloud storage and import that blob as a valid image.\nWith gsutil and gcloud tools installed and their credentials configured, you upload the blob with:\ngsutil cp disk.raw.tar.gz gs://YOURBUCKET/ Where YOURBUCKET is the destination bucket you want your file to end up in.\nAnd import it as an image with:\ngcloud compute images create IMAGENAME --source-uri=SOURCEURI --guest-os-features=UEFI_COMPATIBLE Where:\n IMAGENAME: The name for the final image SOURCEURI: The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in .tar.gz. This is the full path to the blob we just uploaded.  Note that we used --guest-os-features=UEFI_COMPATIBLE as a flag. This indicates that the image will be booted with UEFI and its required. Otherwise, launching the image will try to boot it in legacy mode and it will fail.\nOnce this is over you will have you cOS (or derivative) vanilla image ready for consumption.

COS grub configuration includes three menu entries: first for the main OS system, second for the fallback OS system and a third for the recovery OS.\nFor example the main OS system menu entry could be something like:\nmenuentry \"cOS\" --id cos { search.fs_label COS_STATE root set img=/cOS/active.img set label=COS_ACTIVE loopback loop0 /$img set root=($root) source (loop0)/etc/cos/bootargs.cfg linux (loop0)$kernel $kernelcmd initrd (loop0)$initramfs } Someting relevant to note is that the kernel parameters are not part of the persistent grub.cfg file stored in COS_RECOVERY partition. Kernel parameters are sourced from the loop device of the OS image to boot. This is mainly to keep kernel parameters consistent across different potential OS images or system upgrades.\nIn fact, cOS images and its derivatives, are expected to include a /etc/cos/bootargs.cfg file which provides the definition of the following variables:\n $kernel: Path of the kernel binary $kernelcmd: Kernel parameters $initramfs: Path of the initrd binary  This is the mechanism any cOS image or cOS derivative has to communicate its boot parameters (kernel, kernel params and initrd file) to GRUB2.\nFor example a cOS bootarg.cfg file could be:\nset kernel=/boot/vmlinuz if [ -n \"$recoverylabel\" ]; then # Boot arguments when the image is used as recovery set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=live:CDLABEL=$recoverylabel rd.live.dir=/ rd.live.squashimg=$img panic=5\" else # Boot arguments when the image is used as active/passive set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=LABEL=$label iso-scan/filename=$img panic=5 security=selinux selinux=1\" fi set initramfs=/boot/initrd You can tweak that file to suit your needs if you need to specify persistent boot arguments.\nGrub environment variables cOS (since v0.5.8) makes use of the GRUB2 environment block which can used to define persistent GRUB2 variables across reboots.\nThe default grub configuration loads the /grubenv of any available device and evaluates on next_entry variable and saved_entry variable. By default none is set.\nThe default boot entry is set to the value of saved_entry, in case the variable is not set grub just defaults to the first menu entry.\nnext_entry variable can be used to overwrite the default boot entry for a single boot. If next_entry variable is set this is only being used once, GRUB2 will unset it after reading it for the first time. This is helpful to define the menu entry to reboot to without having to make any permanent config change.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define desired values.\nFor instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Or to set the default entry to fallback system:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default=fallback These examples make of the COS_OEM device, however it could use any device detected by GRUB2 that includes the file /grubenv.

The immutability concept refers to read only root (/) system. To ensure the linux OS is still functional certain paths or areas are required to be writable, in those cases an ephemeral overaly tmpfs is set in place. Additionaly, the immutable rootfs module can also mount a custom list of device blocks with read write permissions, those are mostly devoted to store persistent data.\nThese are the read write paths the module mounts as part of the overlay ephemeral tmpfs: /etc, /root, /home, /opt, /srv, /usr/local and /var.\nThese paths will be all ephemeral unless there is a block device configured to be mounted in the same path.\nIt is important to remark all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nKernel configuraton paramters The immutable rootfs can be configured witht he following kernel parameters:\n  cos-img/filename=\u003cimgfile\u003e: This is one of the main parameters, it defines the location of the image file to boot from.\n  rd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:\u003csize\u003e: This defines the size of the tmpfs used for the ephemeral overlayfs. It can be expressed in MiB or as a % of the available memory. Defaults to rd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:20% if not present.\n  rd.cos.overlay=LABEL=\u003cvol_label\u003e: Optionally and mostly for debugging purposes the overlayfs can be mounted on top of a persistent block device. Block devices can be expressed by LABEL (LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e) or by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e)\n  rd.cos.mount=LABEL:\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This option defines a persistent block device and its mountpoint. Block devices can also be defined by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e). This option can be passed multiple times.\n  rd.cos.oemtimeout=\u003cseconds\u003e: cOS by default assumes the existence of a persistent block device labelled COS_OEM which is used to keep some configuration data (mostly cloud-init files). The immutable rootfs tries to mount this device at very early stages of the boot even before applying the immutable rootfs configs. It done this way to enable to configure the immutable rootfs module within the cloud-init files. As the COS_OEM device might not be always present the boot process just continues without failing after a certain timeout. This option configures such a timeout. Defaults to 10s.\n  rd.cos.debugrw: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. This option sets the root image to be mounted as a writable device. Note this completely breaks the concept of an immutable root. This is helpful for debugging or testing purposes, so changes persist across reboots.\n  rd.cos.disable: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. It disables the execution of any immutable rootfs module logic at boot.\n  Configuration with an environment file The immutable rootfs can be configured with the /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment file. It is important to note that all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nIn the environment file only few options are available:\n  VOLUMES=LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This variable expects a block device and it mountpoint pair space separated list. The default cOS configuration is:\nVOLUMES=\"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\"\n  OVERLAY=: It defines the underlaying device for the overlayfs as in rd.cos.overlay= kernel parameter.\n  DEBUGRW=true: Sets the root (/) to be mounted with read/write permissions.\n  MERGE=true: Sets makes the VOLUMES values to be merged with any other volume that might have been defined in the kernel command line. The merging criteria is simple: any overlapping volume is overwritten all others are appended to whatever was already defined as a kernel parameter. If not defined defaults to true.\n  For exmaple a common cOS configuration can is expressed as part of the cloud-init configuration as follows:\nname:examplestage:rootfs:- name:\"Layout configuration\"environment_file:/run/cos/cos-layout.envenvironment:VOLUMES:\"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\"OVERLAY:\"tmpfs:25%\"","categories":"","description":"Immutable root filesystem configuration parameters\n","excerpt":"Immutable root filesystem configuration parameters\n","ref":"/docs/reference/immutable_rootfs/","tags":"","title":"Immutable Root Filesystem"},{"body":"To upgrade an installed system, just run cos-upgrade and reboot.\nHow it works cOS during installation sets two .img images files in the COS_STATE partition:\n /cOS/active.img labeled COS_ACTIVE: Where cOS typically boots from /cOS/passive.img labeled COS_PASSIVE: Where cOS boots for fallback  Those are used by the upgrade mechanism to prepare and install a pristine cOS each time an upgrade is attempted.\nUpgrade to a specific container image To specify a single container image to upgrade to instead of the regular upgrade channels, run cos-upgrade --docker-image image.\nNote by default cos-upgrade --docker-image checks images against the notary registry server for valid signatures for the images tag.
