Remove the ISO/medium and reboot.\nNote: cos-installer supports other options as well. Run cos-installer --help to see a complete help.\nReleases cOS has 3 variants:\n green: openSUSE based one, shipping packages from OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 repositories. blue: Fedora based one, shipping packages from Fedora 33 repositories orange: Ubuntu based one, shipping packages form Ubuntu 20.10 repositories  We currently support and test only the green variant.\nPublished AMI images We publish AMI images for each release, you can find them into ec2 for example with:\naws ec2 describe-images --filters 'Name=description,Values=cOS*' What to do next?

COS vanilla images are build as part of the CI workflow, see CI artifacts to download one of those.\nThe configuration file of this example has two purposes: first it deploys cOS, second in reboots on the deployed OS and deploys K3S + Fleet + System Upgrades Controller.\nOn first boot it will fail to boot cOS grub menu entry and fallback to cOS-Recovery system. From there it will partition the vanilla image to create the main system partition (COS_STATE) and add an extra partition for persistent data (COS_PERSISTENT). It will use the full disk, a disk of at least 20GiB is recommended. After partitioning it will deploy the main system on COS_STATE and reboot to it.\nOn consequent boots it will simply boot from COS_STATE, there it prepares the persistent areas of the system (arranges few bind mounts inside COS_PERSISTENT) and then it runs an standard installation of K3s, Fleet and System Upgrade Controller. After few minutes after the system is up the K3s cluster is up and running.\nNote this setup similar to the derivative example using Fleet. The main difference is that this example does not require to build any image, it is pure cloud-init configuration based.\nUser data configuration file name:\"Default deployment\"stages:rootfs.after:- if:'[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]'name:\"Repart image\"layout:# It will partition a device including the given filesystem label or part label (filesystem label matches first)device:label:COS_RECOVERYadd_partitions:- fsLabel:COS_STATE# 15Gb for COS_STATE, so the disk should have, at least, 20Gbsize:15360pLabel:state- fsLabel:COS_PERSISTENT# unset size or 0 size means all available spacepLabel:persistentinitramfs:- name:\"Set /etc/hosts\"files:- path:/etc/hostscontent:|127.0.0.1localhost- if:'[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]'name:\"Persist\"commands:- |target=/usr/local/.cos-state # Always want the latest update of systemd conf from the image # TODO: This might break the fallback system mkdir -p \"${target}/etc/systemd/\" rsync -av /etc/systemd/ \"${target}/etc/systemd/\" # Only populate ssh conf once if [ ! -e \"${target}/etc/ssh\" ]; then mkdir -p \"${target}/etc/ssh/\" rsync -av /etc/ssh/ \"${target}/etc/ssh/\" fi # undo /home /opt /root mount from cos immutable-rootfs module # TODO: we could think of configuring custom overlay paths in # immutable rootfs package.

This step generates build metadata (luet build / docker build / buildah ..) Add repository metadata and create a repository from the build phase (luet create-repo) (otherwise, optionally) publish the repository and the artefacts along (luet create-repo --push-images)  While on the client side, the upgrade workflow is:\n luet install (when upgrading from release channels) latest cos on a pristine image file or luet util unpack (when upgrading from specific docker images)  Note: The manual build steps are not stable and will likely change until we build a single CLI to encompass the cos-toolkit components, rather use source .envrc \u0026\u0026 cos-build for the moment being while iterating locally.\nExample The sample repository has the following layout:\n├── Dockerfile ├── .envrc ├── .github │ └── workflows │ ├── build.yaml │ └── test.yaml ├── .gitignore ├── iso.yaml ├── LICENSE ├── .luet.yaml ├── Makefile ├── packages │ ├── sampleOS │ │ ├── 02_upgrades.yaml │ │ ├── 03_branding.yaml │ │ ├── 04_accounting.yaml │ │ ├── build.yaml │ │ ├── definition.yaml │ │ └── setup.yaml │ └── sampleOSService │ ├── 10_sampleOSService.yaml │ ├── build.yaml │ ├── definition.yaml │ └── main.go └── README.md In the detail:\n the packages directory is the sample Luet tree that contains the package definitions [1] which composes the derivative. For an overview of the package syntax and build process, see the official luet documentation .luet.yaml contains a configuration file for luet pointing to the cos repositories, used to fetch packages required in order to build the iso [2] and to fetch definitions from [3]. Makefile and .envrc are just wrappers around luet build and luet create-repo iso.yaml a YAML file that describes what packages to embed in the final ISO  Note: There is nothing special in the layout, and neither the packages folder naming is special. By convention we have chosen to put the compilation specs in the packages folder, the Makefile is just calling luet with a set of default parameters according to this setup.\nThe .envrc is provided as an example to automatize the build process: it will build a docker image with the required dependencies, check the development docs about the local requirements if you plan to build outside of docker.\n[1] In the sample above we just declare two packages: sampleOS and sampleOSService. Their metadata are respectively in packages/sampleOS/definition.yaml and packages/sampleOSService/definition.yaml\n[2] We consume live/systemd-boot and live/syslinux from cos instead of building them from the sample repository\n[3] see also using git submodules instead\nSingle image OS Derivatives are composed by a combination of specs to form a final package that is consumed as a single image OS.\nThe container image during installation and upgrade, is converted to an image file with a backing ext2 fs.\nIn the sample repository we have defined system/sampleOS as our package, that will later on will be converted to image.\nPackages in luet have runtime and buildtime specifications into definition.yaml and build.yaml respectively, and in the buildtime we set:\nrequires:- category:\"system\"name:\"cos\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- category:\"app\"name:\"sampleOSService\"version:\"\u003e=0\"This instruct luet to compose a new image from the results of the compilation of the specified packages, without any version constraints, and use it to run any steps and prelude on top of it.\nWe are interested in the dependencies final images, and not the containers used to build them, so we enable requires_final_images:\nrequires_final_images: true We later run arbitrary steps to tweak the image:\nsteps:- ...And we instruct luet to compose the final artifact as a squash of the resulting container image, composed of all the files:\nunpack:trueA detailed explaination of all the keywords available is in the luet docs along with the supported build strategies.\nWe exclude then a bunch of file that we don’t want to be in the final package (regexp supported):\nexcludes:- ..Note: In the EpinioOS sample, we use requires instead of join:\nrequires:- category:\"system\"name:\"cos\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- name:\"k3s\"category:\"app\"version:\"\u003e=0\"- name:\"policy\"category:\"selinux\"version:\"\u003e=0\"The difference is that with requires we use the building container that was used to build the packages instead of creating a new image from their results: we are not consuming their artifacts in this case, but the environment used to build them. See also the luet docs for more details.\nBuilding Refering to the sampleOS example, we set the Makefile accordingly to compile the system package.\nWith luet installed locally and docker running, in your git checkout you can build it also by running luet build --tree packages system/sampleOS. This will produce an artifact of system/sampleOS. Similary, we could also build separately the sample application with luet build --tree packages app/sampleOSService.\nThe build process by default results in a build folder containing the package and the compilation metadata in order to generate a repository.\nNote on reproducibility: See the difference between our two samples repositories for an explanation of what are the implications of using a .luet.yaml file for building instead of a git submodule.\nAdditional packages In our sample repo we have split the logic of a separate application in app/sampleOSService.\nsampleOSService is just an HTTP server that we would like to have permanently in the system and on boot.\nThus we define it as a dependency in the system/sampleOS’s requires section:\nrequires:...- category:\"app\"name:\"sampleOSService\"version:\"\u003e=0\"Note If you are wondering about copying just single files, there is an upstream open issue about it.\nIn this way, when building our sampleOS package, luet will automatically apply the compilation spec of our package on top.\nTemplating The package build definition supports templating, and global interpolation of build files with multiple values files.\nValues file can be specified during build time in luet with the --values flag (also multiple files are allowed) and, if you are familiar with helm it using the same engine under the hood, so all the functions are available as well.\ncos-toolkit itself uses default values files for every supported distributions.\nFor a more complex example involving values file, see the epinio appliance example.\nTemplates uses cases are for: resharing common pieces between flavors, building for different platforms and architectures, …\nBuild ISO To build an iso from a local repository (the build process, automatically produces a repository in build in the local checkout):\nluet-makeiso ./iso.yaml --local build Where iso.yaml is the iso specification file, and --local build is an optional argument to use also the local repository in the build process.

That would allow us to transform that RAW image in a valid Azure/Google/Amazon Cloud blob that can be transformed into a VM image ready to be launched.\nThis generates a vanilla image that boots into recovery mode and can be used to deploy whatever image you want to the VM. Then you can snapshot that VM into a VM image ready to deploy with the default cOS system or your derivative.\nThe RAW image can then be used into packer templates to generate custom Images, or used as-is with a userdata to deploy a container image of choice with an input user-data.\nBuilding the packages We need to have the packages built locally in order to generate a proper RAW image. Just run:\nsudo make build All the artifacts will be generated under the build directory.\nBuilding the RAW image The RAW image is just a RAW disk image that contains the recovery, so once launched is ready to be used for installing whatever cOS or derivative that you want into the VM disks. This allows us to have a barebones base image that can be used for provisioning whatever cOS you want.\nBuilding the RAW image is as simple as running:\nsudo make raw_disk This will output a disk.raw file in the current directory which can be run with qemu, see booting.\nAWS No other steps are required, the raw disk can be already booted as an AMI image, see booting.\nAzure Requirements:\n Azure Cloud access keys with the appropriate roles and permissions azure-cli  Transform the RAW image into a compatible Azure Cloud blob Currently importing images from storage blobs on Azure Cloud have a few requirements:\n only fixed VHD format is supported VHD disk must have a virtual size aligned to 1 MB LVM is not supported no swap partition  We provide a make target that will do this for you:\nsudo make azure_disk This will create a disk.vhd which is our final artifact\nUploading to Azure Cloud storage and importing it as an image The last step is to upload the blob to Azure Cloud storage and import that blob as a valid image.\nWith azure-cli installed and its credentials configured, you upload the blob with:\naz storage copy --source \u003ccos-azure-image\u003e --destination https://\u003caccount\u003e.blob.core.windows.net/\u003ccontainer\u003e/\u003cdestination-cos-azure-image\u003e And import it as an image with:\naz image create --resource-group \u003cresource-group\u003e --source https://\u003caccount\u003e.blob.core.windows.net/\u003ccontainer\u003e/\u003ccos-azure-image\u003e --os-type linux --hyper-v-generation v2 --name \u003cimage-name\u003e Where cos-azure-image is the blob we just uploaded, basically you can use the same value as you set in --destionation for the upload\nNote that we used --os-type linux --hyper-v-generation v2 as flags. This indicates that the image will be booted with UEFI and its required. Otherwise, launching the image will try to boot it in legacy mode, and it will fail.\nOnce this is over you will have you cOS (or derivative) vanilla image ready for consumption.

This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in .tar.gz. This is the full path to the blob we just uploaded.  Note that we used --guest-os-features=UEFI_COMPATIBLE as a flag. This indicates that the image will be booted with UEFI and its required.

COS grub configuration includes three menu entries: first for the main OS system, second for the fallback OS system and a third for the recovery OS.\nFor example the main OS system menu entry could be something like:\nmenuentry \"cOS\" --id cos { search.fs_label COS_STATE root set img=/cOS/active.img set label=COS_ACTIVE loopback loop0 /$img set root=($root) source (loop0)/etc/cos/bootargs.cfg linux (loop0)$kernel $kernelcmd initrd (loop0)$initramfs } Someting relevant to note is that the kernel parameters are not part of the persistent grub.cfg file stored in COS_RECOVERY partition. Kernel parameters are sourced from the loop device of the OS image to boot. This is mainly to keep kernel parameters consistent across different potential OS images or system upgrades.\nIn fact, cOS images and its derivatives, are expected to include a /etc/cos/bootargs.cfg file which provides the definition of the following variables:\n $kernel: Path of the kernel binary $kernelcmd: Kernel parameters $initramfs: Path of the initrd binary  This is the mechanism any cOS image or cOS derivative has to communicate its boot parameters (kernel, kernel params and initrd file) to GRUB2.\nFor example a cOS bootarg.cfg file could be:\nset kernel=/boot/vmlinuz if [ -n \"$recoverylabel\" ]; then # Boot arguments when the image is used as recovery set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=live:CDLABEL=$recoverylabel rd.live.dir=/ rd.live.squashimg=$img panic=5\" else # Boot arguments when the image is used as active/passive set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=LABEL=$label iso-scan/filename=$img panic=5 security=selinux selinux=1\" fi set initramfs=/boot/initrd You can tweak that file to suit your needs if you need to specify persistent boot arguments.\nGrub environment variables cOS (since v0.5.8) makes use of the GRUB2 environment block which can used to define persistent GRUB2 variables across reboots.\nThe default grub configuration loads the /grubenv of any available device and evaluates on next_entry variable and saved_entry variable. By default none is set.\nThe default boot entry is set to the value of saved_entry, in case the variable is not set grub just defaults to the first menu entry.\nnext_entry variable can be used to overwrite the default boot entry for a single boot. If next_entry variable is set this is only being used once, GRUB2 will unset it after reading it for the first time. This is helpful to define the menu entry to reboot to without having to make any permanent config change.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define desired values.\nFor instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Or to set the default entry to fallback system:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default=fallback These examples make of the COS_OEM device, however it could use any device detected by GRUB2 that includes the file /grubenv.

The immutability concept refers to read only root (/) system. To ensure the linux OS is still functional certain paths or areas are required to be writable, in those cases an ephemeral overaly tmpfs is set in place. Additionaly, the immutable rootfs module can also mount a custom list of device blocks with read write permissions, those are mostly devoted to store persistent data.\nThese are the read write paths the module mounts as part of the overlay ephemeral tmpfs: /etc, /root, /home, /opt, /srv, /usr/local and /var.\nThese paths will be all ephemeral unless there is a block device configured to be mounted in the same path.\nIt is important to remark all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nKernel configuraton paramters The immutable rootfs can be configured witht he following kernel parameters:\n  cos-img/filename=\u003cimgfile\u003e: This is one of the main parameters, it defines the location of the image file to boot from.\n  rd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:\u003csize\u003e: This defines the size of the tmpfs used for the ephemeral overlayfs. It can be expressed in MiB or as a % of the available memory. Defaults to rd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:20% if not present.\n  rd.cos.overlay=LABEL=\u003cvol_label\u003e: Optionally and mostly for debugging purposes the overlayfs can be mounted on top of a persistent block device. Block devices can be expressed by LABEL (LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e) or by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e)\n  rd.cos.mount=LABEL:\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This option defines a persistent block device and its mountpoint. Block devices can also be defined by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e). This option can be passed multiple times.\n  rd.cos.oemtimeout=\u003cseconds\u003e: cOS by default assumes the existence of a persistent block device labelled COS_OEM which is used to keep some configuration data (mostly cloud-init files). The immutable rootfs tries to mount this device at very early stages of the boot even before applying the immutable rootfs configs. It done this way to enable to configure the immutable rootfs module within the cloud-init files. As the COS_OEM device might not be always present the boot process just continues without failing after a certain timeout. This option configures such a timeout. Defaults to 10s.\n  rd.cos.debugrw: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. This option sets the root image to be mounted as a writable device. Note this completely breaks the concept of an immutable root. This is helpful for debugging or testing purposes, so changes persist across reboots.\n  rd.cos.disable: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. It disables the execution of any immutable rootfs module logic at boot.\n  Configuration with an environment file The immutable rootfs can be configured with the /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment file. It is important to note that all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nIn the environment file only few options are available:\n  VOLUMES=LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This variable expects a block device and it mountpoint pair space separated list. The default cOS configuration is:\nVOLUMES=\"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\"\n  OVERLAY=: It defines the underlaying device for the overlayfs as in rd.cos.overlay= kernel parameter.\n  DEBUGRW=true: Sets the root (/) to be mounted with read/write permissions.\n  MERGE=true: Sets makes the VOLUMES values to be merged with any other volume that might have been defined in the kernel command line. The merging criteria is simple: any overlapping volume is overwritten all others are appended to whatever was already defined as a kernel parameter. If not defined defaults to true.\n  For exmaple a common cOS configuration can is expressed as part of the cloud-init configuration as follows:\nname:examplestage:rootfs:- name:\"Layout configuration\"environment_file:/run/cos/cos-layout.envenvironment:VOLUMES:\"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\"OVERLAY:\"tmpfs:25%\"","categories":"","description":"Immutable root filesystem configuration parameters\n","excerpt":"Immutable root filesystem configuration parameters\n","ref":"/docs/reference/immutable_rootfs/","tags":"","title":"Immutable Root Filesystem"},{"body":"To upgrade an installed system, just run cos-upgrade and reboot.\nHow it works cOS during installation sets two .img images files in the COS_STATE partition:\n /cOS/active.img labeled COS_ACTIVE: Where cOS typically boots from /cOS/passive.img labeled COS_PASSIVE: Where cOS boots for fallback  Those are used by the upgrade mechanism to prepare and install a pristine cOS each time an upgrade is attempted.\nUpgrade to a specific container image To specify a single container image to upgrade to instead of the regular upgrade channels, run cos-upgrade --docker-image image.\nNote by default cos-upgrade --docker-image checks images against the notary registry server for valid signatures for the images tag.

It forms an abstraction layer, which is then translated to Dockerfiles and built by our CI (optionally) for re-usal. A derivative can be built by parts of the manifest, or reusing it entirely, container images included.\nThe fundamental phases can be summarized in the following steps:\n Build packages from container images (and optionally keep build caches) Extract artefacts from containers Add metadata(s) and create a repository (optionally) publish the repository and the artefacts  The developer of the derivative applies a customization layer during build, which is an augmentation layer in the same form of cos-toolkit itself. An example repository is provided that shows how to build a customOS that can be maintained with a container image registry.\nDistribution The OS delivery mechanism is done via container registries. The developer that wants to provide upgrades for the custom OS will push the resulting container images to the container registry. It will then be used by the installed system to pull upgrades from.\nUpgrade mechanism There are two different upgrade mechanisms available that can be used from a maintainer perspective: (a) release channels or (b) providing a container image reference ( e.g. my.registry.com/image:tag ) that can be tweaked in the customization phases to achieve the desired effect.\n","categories":"","description":"High level architecture of cOS and its components.\n","excerpt":"High level architecture of cOS and its components.\n","ref":"/docs/reference/high_level_architecture/","tags":"","title":"High level architecture"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"cOS tutorials and real life use-case samples\n","excerpt":"cOS tutorials and real life use-case samples\n","ref":"/docs/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":" Github project for a short-term Roadmap  Samples repositories  Build a derivative and upgrade it with fleet Sample repository EpinioOS sample repository  ","categories":"","description":"References for cOS derivatives, like common featuresets, high level architecture\n","excerpt":"References for cOS derivatives, like common featuresets, high level …","ref":"/docs/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":"For Vagrant Boxes, OVA and QEMU images at the moment we are relying on packer templates.\n","categories":"","description":"Building VBox, OVA, QEMU, etc. images of your derivative with Packer\n","excerpt":"Building VBox, OVA, QEMU, etc. images of your derivative with Packer\n","ref":"/docs/creating-derivatives/packer/","tags":"","title":"Building images with Packer"},{"body":"Welcome!\nThe cOS (containerized OS) distribution is entirely built over GitHub.
